# Gift with Purchase Strategy

Design irresistible promotional offers that convert browsers to buyers, introduce new products, and build lasting loyalty through Estee Lauder's revolutionary strategic generosity system.

---

- Introducing customers to new products or services
- Building customer loyalty and repeat purchase
- Competing when you can't win on price alone
- Creating promotional campaigns with measurable ROI
- Designing freemium, trial, or bonus structures

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| product_line | Yes | Products/services available for promotion |
| objective | Yes | Primary goal (conversion, upsell, loyalty, product introduction) |
| customer_segments | No | Different customer types to target |
| budget | No | Available investment for gift components |
| constraints | No | Limitations (inventory, margins, fulfillment) |

## The Strategic Generosity Framework

### Core Philosophy

**Estee's insight:** "The gift is not charity—it is strategic generosity that builds empires."

A Gift with Purchase is an investment with predictable returns:
- Customer receives unexpected value → feels reciprocity
- Gift introduces products they wouldn't try otherwise → expands basket
- Memorable experience → generates word-of-mouth
- Value perception exceeds cost → creates competitive moat

### The Five Components

#### 1. Threshold Design

The purchase amount required to receive the gift.

**Principles:**
- Set just above current average order value to drive upsell
- Make it achievable—stretch, not strain
- Create multiple tiers for different value levels

**Formula:** Current AOV + 15-25% = Sweet Spot Threshold

#### 2. Gift Composition

What the customer receives.

**Estee's method:** A curated collection of deluxe samples across the product portfolio.

**Design principles:**
- Include hero products (what you want them to love)
- Include discovery products (what they wouldn't try otherwise)
- Make each item usable enough to experience real results
- Package attractively—the gift itself communicates brand value

**The Introduction Formula:**
| Item | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1 Hero product sample | Reinforces purchase decision |
| 1-2 Adjacent category items | Cross-sell introduction |
| 1 Aspirational item | Introduces premium tier |
| 1 Exclusive/Limited item | Creates urgency and specialness |

#### 3. Presentation Strategy

How the gift is positioned and delivered.

**Principles:**
- Emphasize VALUE not cost ("$75 value" not "$15 cost to us")
- Create visual appeal—the unboxing matters
- Surprise when possible (unexpected value creates stronger reciprocity)
- Name it something special ("Your Beauty Bonus" not "free samples")

#### 4. Introduction Sequence

How each gift item leads to full-size purchase.

**For each item in the gift:**
- Clear usage instructions
- Time to expected results
- Easy path to full-size purchase
- Follow-up trigger (running low, limited offer)

#### 5. Measurement Framework

How you track and optimize ROI.

**Key metrics:**
- Gift redemption rate (% of eligible purchases that claim)
- Threshold bump rate (% who increase order to qualify)
- Gift-to-purchase conversion (% who buy items introduced in gift)
- Customer lifetime value impact (LTV of gift recipients vs. non)
- Word-of-mouth indicators (mentions, referrals, shares)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Gift with Purchase Program: [Campaign Name]

### Objective
[Primary goal and success criteria]

### Threshold Design
| Tier | Purchase Amount | Gift Value | Target Segment |
|------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| [Basic] | $[X] | $[Y] value | [Segment] |
| [Premium] | $[X] | $[Y] value | [Segment] |

**Rationale:** [Why these thresholds based on current AOV]

### Gift Composition

**[Tier Name] Gift Contains:**
| Item | Purpose | Full-Size Price | Path to Purchase |
|------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| [Item 1] | Hero reinforcement | $X | [Trigger] |
| [Item 2] | Category introduction | $X | [Trigger] |
| [Item 3] | Premium aspiration | $X | [Trigger] |
| [Item 4] | Exclusivity/urgency | $X | [Trigger] |

**Calculated gift value:** $[Total]
**Estimated gift cost:** $[Total]
**Value-to-cost ratio:** [X]:1

### Presentation Strategy
- Gift name: "[Name]"
- Value messaging: "[Exact copy]"
- Packaging notes: [Description]
- Surprise element: [If applicable]

### Introduction Sequence
For each gift item:
1. [Item]: [Instructions] → [Results timeline] → [Follow-up trigger]
2. ...

### Measurement Plan
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Redemption rate | [X]% | [How tracked] |
| Threshold bump rate | [X]% | [How tracked] |
| Gift-to-purchase conversion | [X]% | [How tracked] |
| LTV impact | +[X]% | [How tracked] |

### Timeline and Logistics
- Campaign period: [Dates]
- Inventory required: [Quantities]
- Fulfillment process: [How delivered]
```

## Constraints

- Gift must provide genuine value, not feel cheap or promotional
- Each item must have clear path to full-size conversion
- Threshold must be achievable—frustrating customers destroys goodwill
- Track everything—strategic generosity requires strategic measurement
- Never position as "free"—position as "gift" or "bonus" (worth something)

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings

## Example

**Input:** "I run a SaaS project management tool with monthly subscriptions. How do I design a Gift with Purchase for annual plan upgrades?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Gift with Purchase Program: "Annual Accelerator Bundle"

### Objective
Convert monthly subscribers to annual plans (12-month commitment) while introducing premium features they wouldn't otherwise try.

**Success criteria:** 15% of monthly subscribers convert to annual within campaign period.

### Threshold Design
| Tier | Purchase Amount | Gift Value | Target Segment |
|------|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| Annual Pro | $199/year (save $40) | $150 value | Current monthly Pro |
| Annual Team | $499/year (save $100) | $350 value | Current monthly Team |

**Rationale:** Annual commitment removes monthly churn risk. Gift value exceeds monthly savings to make annual feel like clear win.

### Gift Composition

**Annual Pro Gift Contains:**
| Item | Purpose | Full-Size Price | Path to Purchase |
|------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| 3-month Premium Templates Access | Hero—their most-requested feature | $45/yr | Expires in 3 months → "Continue for $45/year" prompt |
| 1-on-1 Onboarding Call | Category intro—builds relationship | $75 value | Call surfaces Team plan benefits → "Upgrade to Team" offer |
| "Power User" Course Access | Premium aspiration—advanced features | $29 value | Course mentions Team-only features |
| Founding Member Badge + Early Access | Exclusivity—status and access | Priceless | Creates identity, increases switching cost |

**Calculated gift value:** $150
**Estimated gift cost:** $25 (staff time + existing assets)
**Value-to-cost ratio:** 6:1

### Presentation Strategy
- Gift name: "Annual Accelerator Bundle"
- Value messaging: "Upgrade to annual and unlock your $150 Accelerator Bundle—everything you need to get 10x more from [Product Name]"
- Packaging notes: Dedicated welcome email with visual "gift box" unwrapping GIF; items revealed one at a time over first week
- Surprise element: Day 30 surprise—"Because you're an annual member, here's early access to [new feature]"

### Introduction Sequence
1. **Premium Templates (Day 1):** Immediate access → See value in first project → Day 75 "Your template access expires in 2 weeks—continue for $45/year"
2. **Onboarding Call (Day 3 invite):** Schedule within first 2 weeks → Call includes Team feature demo → "Based on your needs, Team plan would add [specific value]"
3. **Power User Course (Day 7):** 5-lesson drip over 2 weeks → Lesson 4 mentions Team-only integrations → Soft upgrade prompt
4. **Founding Member Badge (Day 1):** Visible in profile immediately → Creates identity investment → "Founding members get first access to [roadmap items]"

### Measurement Plan
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Monthly-to-annual conversion rate | 15% | Stripe subscription changes |
| Template continuation rate | 40% | Checkout completions at Day 90 |
| Pro-to-Team upgrade rate | 10% | Post-call survey + plan changes |
| Annual renewal rate (Year 2) | 85% | Cohort tracking |
| NPS of annual vs. monthly | +15 pts | Quarterly NPS survey |

### Timeline and Logistics
- Campaign period: Q1 (Jan 15 - Mar 15)
- Inventory required: Course already exists; Template access automated; Staff time for calls (~2 hrs/conversion)
- Fulfillment process: Automated email sequence triggered on annual signup; Calendly link for onboarding call; Badge auto-applied to profile
